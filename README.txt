Grouping Algorithms
by Thai Nguyen
===================

Welcome!

Grouping Algorithms is a software to match students up with each other based on their personalities.
Using the criteria on 16personalities.com, students' compatibility scores will be determined by their personality types and how well two certain personality types match up with each other.
(For example, two people who are extroverted and kind to each other would be matched up well.)
